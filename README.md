# Farming By Hand

First, "reaping" takes "crops" and makes "sheaves", which is easier with a "scythe" or "sickle"
Second, "threshing" takes sheaves and makes "husked grain" and "straw", which is easier with a "flail"
Third, "winnowing" takes "husked grain" and makes "grain" and "chaff", which is easier with a "winnowing fork" or a "winnowing fan"
