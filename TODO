Dedup:
  ✔ inventory and history are practically identical @done(20-11-10 04:39)
    refactor to eliminate duplication!
  ☐ KibbutzContext
    difference between console client and monogame client is only a handful of interfaces so having to update this twice each time i add a new context is bleh
Dweller Statistics:
  ✔ DwellerStatisticStore @done(20-11-10 05:26)
  ☐ remove all statistics when a dweller is abandoned
  ☐ get list of statistics for a dweller?
  ☐ set statistics for a dweller upon creation?
  ☐ view hunger level when using "dweller" command
Dweller Hunger:
  ☐ hunger exists for a dweller
  ☐ rest generates 0.05 hunger
  ☐ exploring generates 0.1 hunger
  ☐ gather generates 0.1 hunger
Dweller Fatigue:
  ☐ fatigue exists for a dweller
  ☐ rest restores 1.0 fatigue
  ☐ exploring generates 0.5 fatigue
  ☐ gathering generates 0.5 fatigue
